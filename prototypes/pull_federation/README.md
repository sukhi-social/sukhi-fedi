# Pull Federation prototype

A runnable model of the "Pull Federation" idea: instance A *notifies*
with per-actor sequence ids, instance B *pulls* lazily when it has room.
No network, no deps, no clock: every function takes `now` (ms), so the
whole protocol is deterministic and unit-testable.

```
mix test
```

(Elixir 1.20 / OTP 28, same as the repo's `mise.toml`.)

## Spec step → code

| Step | Where |
| --- | --- |
| 1. A has new activities, B follows the actors | `Origin.publish/3`, `Origin.follow/3` |
| 2. Notify with `[a:123, b:124]` | `Origin.due_notifications/2` (only actors that domain follows) |
| 3. Compare with own ids, plan if different | `Puller.notify/4` → `Seq.behind/2` |
| 4. Busy → postpone | `Puller.next_pull(_, _, busy?)` |
| 5. Pull when scheduled | `Puller.next_pull/3` |
| 6. A busy → decline | `Origin.open_stream/4` → `{:error, {:busy, retry_ms}}`; B backs off with jitter in `finish_pull/5` |
| 7. Stream of relevant activities | `Origin.open_stream/4` returns events past B's cursors |
| 8. B verifies signatures | `Puller.apply_activity/3` calls the injected `verify` |
| 9. A waits a few seconds before the next notification | `notify_quiet_ms` coalescing |

## Decisions the prototype makes (all easy to change)

- **Only public / unlisted / followers-only is pullable** (`Visibility`).
  Direct messages get no sequence number, so a gap in a sequence never
  reveals that a private activity exists.
- **Sequence ids, not hashes or dates.** Per actor, integers, from 1.
- **Notifications are untrusted.** Shape-checked once (`Seq.parse/1`, ≤1000 entries),
  actors B does not follow are dropped, and a per-origin floor
  (`min_notify_gap_ms`, 1000) rate-limits them. Authenticity is meant
  to be the OIP/signature layer; here it is the injected `verify`.
- **Bounded pool.** `max_pending` origins; a full pool drops *new* origins
  but still merges updates for origins already queued.
- **Both ways for Delete.** Push and pull go through one function
  (`apply_activity/3`). A Delete leaves a tombstone, so a Create that
  arrives afterwards (by either path) is ignored; duplicates are no-ops.
- **Reverse-DDoS control.** A declines with `retry_after`; B uses
  `max(retry_after, exponential backoff) + jitter`.
  `Origin.recovered/2` is the "I'm back" broadcast, spread by a jitter fn.
- **Cursor moves per event**, so an interrupted stream resumes where it stopped.

## Not modelled yet

- Real HTTP / streaming (NDJSON or chunked) and HTTP-signature verification.
- Log retention: if B's cursor is older than what A kept, A needs a
  "cursor too old, fall back to outbox crawl" answer.
- Update / Follow / Undo semantics over pull (only Create / Delete here).
- PostgreSQL shape (e.g. one `bigserial` per actor via an `(actor_id, seq)`
  unique index, stream = `WHERE seq > $cursor ORDER BY seq`).
- Choosing push vs pull per target from metrics.
